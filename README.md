n8n (pronounced “n-eight-n”) is an open‑source workflow automation, Agentic AI, and orchestration platform. It lets you build AI Agents and connect APIs, databases, and services with a visual, node‑based editor, while still giving you the power to drop into code when you need it. For agentic AI, that combination—no‑code orchestration with just‑enough code—makes n8n an ideal control plane for prototyping and building systems that can perceive, plan, and act across tools.
